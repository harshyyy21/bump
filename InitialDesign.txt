Overview: 

Bump is a social media app where users are sent notifications (bumps)
whenever they are in the same vicinity as one of their friends


Requirements: 

Track users location (allow forever, when using the app, or only once)

Have a profile page
 - will contain users previous bumps
 - friends can interact with the bumps (comment, like, etc)
 - show list of friends 
   - friends != followers, if you add someone and they accept they're considered your friend (so you cant follow someone and not have them follow you as you see in insta and twitter)

Add other users as friends
 - can search by username or email?

Allow configurations for bumps
 - distance user can bump
 - number of times you can bump into the same person
 - frequency of when the app checks your location for potential bump?

Feed page (home page):
 - show friends bump history and interactions
